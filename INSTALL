INSTALLATION
============

First unpack the kit, if you have not already done so:

   gzip -d < GetoptLong-x.y.tar.gz | tar xf -
   cd GetoptLong-x.y

Getopt::Long can be installed with:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

This will install Getopt/Long.pm, newgetopt.pl and the Getopt::Long
documentation. Note that "make install" will usually require super
user privilege unless your Perl is installed in a location you have
write access to.

The kit contains two program skeleton files that can be used to start
writing application programs: skel.pl and skel2.pl. The first skeleton
uses Getopt::Long in a standard way. The second skeleton combines
Getopt::Long with the Pod::Usage module that extracts help texts from
the embedded documentation. The Pod::Usage module is not part of
standard Perl, it can be fetched from CPAN.
