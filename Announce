Version 2.4 of module Getopt::Long is now available via CPAN. It
should soon appear in directory authors/Johan_Vromans as file
GetoptLong-2.4.tar.gz.

Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
the traditional one-letter options.

The kit contains:

  README         -- Introductionary text
  GetoptLong.pm  -- version 2.4 of Getopt::Long (subroutine GetOptions)
  newgetopt.pl   -- version 1.17 of newgetopt.pl (subroutine NGetOpt)
  Makefile.PL    -- Makefile for installation
  skel.pl        -- Skeleton program to use Getopt::Long
  skel2.pl       -- Skeleton program to use Getopt::Long with Pod::Usage

The README document is attached to this message.

The best way to download from CPAN is to use a Web browser and point
it to http://www.perl.com/CPAN. It will automagically be redirected to
a CPAN site in your neighborhood.

New features in this version
----------------------------

* Pass-through of unrecognized options. Makes it easy to write wrapper
  programs that process some of the command line options but pass the
  others to another program.

* Options can be of type HASH, now you can say

    --define foo=bar

  and have $opt_define{"foo"} set to "bar".

* An enhanced skeleton program, skel2.pl, that combines the power of
  Getopt::Long with Pod::Usage. 
  Module Pod::Usage can be obtained from CPAN,
  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/Brad_Appleton. 

Possible incompatibility
------------------------

Previous versions of Getopt::Long always downcased the option variable
names when ignorecase was in effect. This bug has been corrected. As a
consequence, &GetOptions ("Foo") will now set variable $opt_Foo
instead of $opt_foo.
