Version 2.11 of module Getopt::Long is now available via CPAN. It
should soon appear in directory authors/Johan_Vromans as file
GetoptLong-2.11.tar.gz. It will be standard part of Perl 5.004 or later.

Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
the traditional one-letter options (including option bundling).

The kit contains:

  README         -- Introductionary text
  GetoptLong.pm  -- version 2.11 of Getopt::Long (subroutine GetOptions)
  newgetopt.pl   -- version 1.17 of newgetopt.pl (subroutine NGetOpt)
  Makefile.PL    -- Makefile for installation
  skel.pl        -- Skeleton program to use Getopt::Long
  skel2.pl       -- Skeleton program to use Getopt::Long with Pod::Usage

The README document is attached to this message.

The best way to download from CPAN is to use a Web browser and point
it to http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ (include the final slash!). It will
automagically be redirected to a CPAN site in your neighborhood. URL:

Changes in version 2.11
-----------------------

* User linkage may be an object, provided the object is really a hash.

  For example:

    {	package Foo;
	sub new () { return bless {}; }
    }

    my $linkage = Foo->new();

    GetOptions ($linkage, ... );

* Some bug fixes in handling obscure cases of pass-through.

Previous released version was 2.10.
