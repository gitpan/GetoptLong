Version 2.17 of module Getopt::Long is now available via CPAN. It
should soon appear in directory authors/Johan_Vromans as file
GetoptLong-2.17.tar.gz. It will be standard part of Perl 5.005 or later.

Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
the traditional one-letter options (including option bundling).

The README document is attached to this message.

The best way to download from CPAN is to use a Web browser and point
it to http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ (include the final slash!). It will
automagically be redirected to a CPAN site in your neighborhood.

Changes in version 2.17
-----------------------

* Getopt::Long::config is renamed Getopt::Long::Configure. The old
  name will remain supported without being documented.

* Options can have the specifier '+' to denote that the option value
  must be incremented each time the option occurs on the command line.
  For example:

     my $more = 2;
     Getopt::Long::Configure("bundling");
     GetOptions ("v+" => \$more);
     print STDOUT ("more = $more\n");

  will print "more = 3" when called with "-v", "more = 4" when called
  with "-vv" (or "-v -v"), and so on.

* Getopt::Long now uses autoloading. This substantially reduces the
  resources required to 'use Getopt::Long' (about 100 lines of over
  1300 total).

* To install, it is now required to use the official procedure:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test
     make install

Previous released version was 2.16.
